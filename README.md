Machine Learning-Based Loan Approval Automation: Enhancing Efficiency, Accuracy, and Fairness in Credit Decision-Making
# Loan Approval Automation using Machine Learning

This repository contains the MSc dissertation project:  
**"Machine Learning-Based Loan Approval Automation: Enhancing Efficiency, Accuracy, and Fairness in Credit Decision-Making."**  

The project explores the use of **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **ensemble models** (stacking and voting) to automate the loan approval process, improve predictive accuracy, and ensure fairer decision-making.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
Financial institutions traditionally rely on manual evaluation for loan approvals, which is time-consuming and prone to human bias.  
This project automates the loan approval process using **machine learning techniques**, enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and fairness.

Key objectives:
- Automate the loan approval workflow.
- Optimize predictive performance via **hyperparameter tuning**.
- Improve interpretability using **LIME** and **SHAP** for explainable AI.
- Ensure balanced decision-making by addressing **class imbalance**.

## ðŸ§  Models Implemented
- **Random Forest** â€“ Tuned using GridSearchCV.
- **XGBoost** â€“ Optimized for improved performance.
- **Stacking Ensemble** â€“ Combines Random Forest and XGBoost with a **Logistic Regression meta-learner**.
- **Voting Ensemble** â€“ Soft voting combining tuned Random Forest and XGBoost.

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics
We evaluated performance using:
- **Accuracy** â€“ Overall correctness.
- **Precision & Recall** â€“ For class-specific performance.
- **F1 Score** â€“ Balance between precision and recall.
- **ROC-AUC** â€“ Discrimination ability.
